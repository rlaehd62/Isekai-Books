## Introduction

</div>

Back in the school days, I enjoyed to read novesl. My parents didn't hesitate to buy me few books whether it's comics or not.
After few years of technological progress, I started to read novels in web. As you know, not every web novel is good enough to feel satisfied.
Sometimes It feels like you're totally scammed. And It leads me to start this project, Make tailor-made novels using AI.
